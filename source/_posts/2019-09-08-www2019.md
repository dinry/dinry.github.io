# 1.Cross-domain Recommendation Without Sharing User-relevant Data
 研究方向：cross-domain recommendation Task

 Goal: combine data from different websites to improve recommendation task

 Challenge:
Despite many research efforts on this task, the main drawback is that they largely assume the data of different systems can be fully shared.

methods: NATR(short for Neural Attentive Transfer Recommendation)
To avoid the leak of user privacy during the data sharing process, it consider sharing only the information of the item side, rather than user behavior data. Specifically, we transfer the item embeddings across domains, making it easier for two companies to reach a consensus (e.g., legal policy) on data sharing since the data to be shared is user-irrelevant and has no explicit semantics.

step:

Our proposed solution, which has three steps, is illustrated in Figure 1.
* In the first step, an embedding-based recommender model, MF for example, is trained on the user-item interaction matrix of the auxiliary domain to obtain item embeddings.
* In the second step, item embeddings of the auxiliary domain are sent to the target domain; note that only the embeddings of overlapped items are necessary to be sent, which are subjected to the data-sharing policy between two companies.
* Finally, the target domain trains a recommender model with the consideration of the transferred item embeddings.
## contribution
* We present a new paradigm for cross-domain recommendation without sharing user-relevant data, in which only item-side data can be shared across domains. To allow the transferring of CF signal, we propose to share the item embeddings which are learned from user-item interactions of the auxiliary domain.
* We propose a new solution NATR to resolve the key challenges in leveraging transferred item embeddings. The twolevel attention design allows NATR to distill useful signal from transferred item embeddings, and appropriately combine them with the data of the target domain.
* We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to demonstrate our proposed method. More ablation studies verify the efficacy of our designed components, and the utility of transferred item embeddings in addressing the data sparsity issue.

# 3.Exploiting Ratings, Reviews and Relationships for Item Recommendations in Topic Based Social Networks
## Abstract
Many e-commerce platforms today allow users to give their rating scores and reviews on items as well as to establish social relationships with other users. As a result, such platforms accumulate heterogeneous data including numeric scores, short textual reviews, and social relationships. HHowever, many recommender systems only consider historical user feedbacks in modeling user preferences. More specifically, most existing recommendation approaches only use rating scores but ignore reviews and social relationships in the user-generated data. In this paper, we propose TSNPF—a latent factor model to effectively capture user preferences and item features. Employing Poisson factorization, TSNPF fully exploits the wealth of information in rating scores, review text and social relationships altogether. It extracts topics of items and users from the review text and makes use of similarities between user pairs with social relationships, which results in a comprehensive understanding of user preferences. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our TSNPF approach is highly effective at recommending items to users.
## contribution
* We propose a method based on Gamma-Poisson distribution to extract the topic intensities of items and users from usergenerated textual reviews. Compared to previous techniques, our method is able to address the usual problem of data scarcity.
* We propose TSNPF, a conjugate graphical model based on Poisson factorization which only models non-zero observations in ratings, reviews and social relations simultaneously via interpretable user preferences and item attributes. In addition, we propose a closed form mean-field variational inference method to train TSNPF.
* We evaluate the performance of TSNPF using three publicly available real datasets. The results show that TSNPF outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.

# 4.GhostLink: Latent Network Inference for Influence-aware Recommendation.(introduction 写的不错)
## Abstract (probabilistic graphical model)
Social influence plays a vital role in shaping a user’s behavior in online communities dealing with items of fine taste like movies, food, and beer. For online recommendation, this implies that users’ preferences and ratings are influenced due to other individuals. Given only time-stamped reviews of users, can we find out whoinfluences- whom, and characteristics of the underlying influence network? Can we use this network to improve recommendation?

While prior works in social-aware recommendation have leveraged social interaction by considering the observed social network of users, many communities like Amazon, Beeradvocate, and Ratebeer do not have explicit user-user links.Therefore,we propose GhostLink, an unsupervised probabilistic graphical model, to automatically learn the latent influence network underlying a review community – given only the temporal traces (timestamps) of users’ posts and their content. Based on extensive experiments with four real-world datasets with 13 million reviews, we show that GhostLink improves item recommendation by around 23% over state-of-the-art methods that do not consider this influence. As additional use-cases, we show that GhostLink can be used to differentiate between users’ latent preferences and influenced ones, as well as to detect influential users based on the learned influence graph.
## contribution
* We propose an unsupervised probabilistic generative model GhostLink based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation to learn a latent influence graph in online communities without requiring explicit user-user links or a social network. This is the first work that solely relies on timestamped review data.
* We propose an efficient algorithm based on Gibbs sampling to estimate the hidden parameters in GhostLink that empirically demonstrates fast convergence.
* We perform large-scale experiments in four communities with 13 million reviews, 0.5 mil. items, and 1 mil. users where we show improved recommendation for item rating prediction by around 23% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we analyze the properties of the influence graph and use it for use-cases like finding influential members in the community.

# 5.Graph Neural Networks for Social Recommendation
## Abstract
In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can naturally integrate node information and topological structure, have been demonstrated to be powerful in learning on graph data. These advantages of GNNs provide great potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and learning latent factors of users and items is the key.

However, building social recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the useruser social graph and the user-item graph).

To address the three aforementioned challenges simultaneously, in this paper,we present a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models two graphs and heterogeneous strengths. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework GraphRec.
## contribution
* We propose a novel graph neural network GraphRec, which can model graph data in social recommendations coherently;
* We provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph;
* We introduce a method to consider heterogeneous strengths of social relations mathematically;
* We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on various real-world datasets.

# 6.Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Networks for Dynamic Recommender Systems(工程应用)
## Abstract
Recommender systems that can learn from cross-session data to dynamically predict the next item a user will choose are crucial for online platforms. However, existing approaches often use out-ofthe-box sequence models which are limited by speed and memory consumption, are often infeasible for production environments, and usually do not incorporate cross-session information, which is crucial for effective recommendations.

Here we propose Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Networks (HierTCN), a hierarchical deep learning architecture that makes dynamic recommendations based on users’ sequential multi-session interactions with items. HierTCN is designed for web-scale systems with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users. It consists of two levels of models: The high-level model uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to aggregate users’ evolving long-term interests across different sessions, while the low-level model is implemented with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), utilizing both the long-term interests and the short-term interactions within sessions to predic  the next interaction.

## contribution
* HierTCN has a significant performance improvement over existing deep learning models by about 30% on a public XING dataset and 18% on a private large-scale Pinterest dataset.
* Compared with RNN-based approaches, HierTCN is 2.5 times faster in terms of training time and allows for much easier gradient backpropagation.
* Compared with CNN-based approaches, HierTCN requires roughly 10% data memory usage and allows for easy latent feature extraction.

# 7.How Intention Informed Recommendations Modulate Choices: A Field Study of SpokenWord Content
## Abstract
People’s content choices are ideally driven by their intentions, aspirations, and plans.

However, in reality, choices may be modulated by recommendation systems which are typically trained to promote popular items and to reinforce users’ historical behavior. As a result, the utility and user experience of content consumption can be affected implicitly and undesirably.

To study this problem, we conducted
a 2 × 2 randomized controlled field experiment (105 urban
college students) to compare the effects of intention informed recommendations
with classical intention agnostic systems. The study
was conducted in the context of spokenwordweb content (podcasts)
which is often consumed through subscription sites or apps. We
modified a commercial podcast app to include (1) a recommender
that takes into account users’ stated intentions at onboarding, and
(2) a Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender during daily use.
Our study suggests that: (1) intention-aware recommendations can
significantly raise users’ interactions (subscriptions and listening)
with channels and episodes related to intended topics by over 24%,
even if such a recommender is only used during onboarding, and (2)
the CF-based recommender doubles users’ explorations on episodes
from not-subscribed channels and improves satisfaction for users
onboarded with the intention-aware recommender.

# 8.How Serendipity Improves User Satisfaction with Recommendations? A Large-Scale User Evaluation
## Abstract
Recommendation serendipity is being increasingly recognized as
being equally important as the other beyond-accuracy objectives
(such as novelty and diversity), in eliminating the “filter bubble”
phenomenon of the traditional recommender systems.

However,
little work has empirically verified the effects of serendipity on
increasing user satisfaction and behavioral intention.

In this paper,
we report the results of a large-scale user survey (involving over
3,000 users) conducted in an industrial mobile e-commerce setting.
The study has identified the significant causal relationships from
novelty, unexpectedness, relevance, and timeliness to serendipity,
and from serendipity to user satisfaction and purchase intention.
Moreover, our findings reveal that user curiosity plays a moderating
role in strengthening the relationships from novelty to serendipity
and from serendipity to satisfaction. Our third contribution lies in
the comparison of several recommender algorithms, which demonstrates
the significant improvements of the serendipity-oriented
algorithm over the relevance- and novelty-oriented approaches in
terms of user perceptions. We finally discuss the implications of
this experiment, which include the feasibility of developing a more
precise metric for measuring recommendation serendipity, and
the potential benefit of a curiosity-based personalized serendipity
strategy for recommender systems.

# 9.Improving Outfit Recommendation with Co-supervision of Fashion Generation (图像：衣服类)
## Abstract
The task of fashion recommendation includes twomain challenges:
visual understanding and visual matching. Visual understanding
aims to extract effective visual features. Visual matching aims to
model a human notion of compatibility to compute a match between
fashion items. Most previous studies rely on recommendation
loss alone to guide visual understanding and matching. Although
the features captured by thesemethods describe basic characteristics
(e.g., color, texture, shape) of the input items, they are
not directly related to the visual signals of the output items (to be
recommended). This is problematic because the aesthetic characteristics
(e.g., style, design), based on which we can directly infer
the output items, are lacking. Features are learned under the recommendation
loss alone, where the supervision signal is simply
whether the given two items are matched or not.

To address this problem, we propose a neural co-supervision
learning framework, called the FAshion RecommendationMachine
(FARM). FARM improves visual understanding by incorporating
the supervision of generation loss, which we hypothesize to be
able to better encode aesthetic information. FARMenhances visual
matching by introducing a novel layer-to-layer matching mechanism
to fuse aesthetic information more effectively, and meanwhile
avoiding paying too much attention to the generation quality
and ignoring the recommendation performance.

Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show
that FARM outperforms state-of-the-art models on outfit recommendation,
in terms of AUC and MRR. Detailed analyses of generated
and recommended items demonstrate that FARM can encode
better features and generate high quality images as references to
improve recommendation performance.

## contribution
* We propose a neural co-supervision learning framework, FARM, for outfit recommendation that simultaneously yields recommendation and generation.
* We propose a layer-to-layer matching mechanism that acts as a bridge between generation and recommendation, and improves recommendation by leveraging generation features.
* Our proposed approach is shown to be effective in experiments on two large-scale datasets.

# 10.Jointly Learning Explainable Rules for Recommendation with Knowledge Graph
## Abstract
Explainability and effectiveness are two key aspects for building recommender
systems. Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side
information to achieve better recommendation performance.

However,
these methods have some weaknesses: (1) prediction of neural
network-based embedding methods are hard to explain and debug;
(2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., meta path-based models)
require manual efforts and domain knowledge to define patterns
and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutable
and complementary).

In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning
framework to integrate induction of explainable rules from knowledge
graph with construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation
model. The framework encourages two modules to complement
each other in generating effective and explainable recommendation:
1) inductive rules, mined from item-centric knowledge graphs,
summarize common multi-hop relational patterns for inferring different
item associations and provide human-readable explanation
for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented
by induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing
with the cold-start issue.

Extensive experiments1 show that our
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in item
recommendation over baselines on real-world datasets. Our model
demonstrates robust performance over “noisy" item knowledge
graphs, generated by linking item names to related entities.
## contribution
* We utilize a large-scale knowledge graph to derive rules between items from item associations.
* We propose a joint optimization framework that induces rules from knowledge graphs and recommends items based on the rules at the same time.
* We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our framework in accurate and explainable recommendation.

# 11.Jointly Leveraging Intent and Interaction Signals to Predict User Satisfaction with Slate Recommendations.
## Abstract
Detecting and understanding implicit measures of user satisfaction
are essential for enhancing recommendation quality. When users
interact with a recommendation system, they leave behind fine
grained traces of interaction signals, which contain valuable information
that could help gauging user satisfaction. User interaction
with such systems is often motivated by a specific need or intent, often
not explicitly specified by the user, but can nevertheless inform
on how the user interacts with, and the extent to which the user is
satisfied by the recommendations served. In this work, we consider
a complex recommendation scenario, called Slate Recommendation,
wherein a user is presented with an ordered set of collections, called
slates, in a specific page layout. We focus on the context of music
streaming and leverage fine-grained user interaction signals to
tackle the problem of predicting user satisfaction.

We hypothesize that user interactions are conditional on the
specific intent users have when interacting with a recommendation
system, and highlight the need for explicitly considering user
intent when interpreting interaction signals. We present diverse
approaches to identify user intents (interviews, surveys and a quantitative
approach) and identify a set of common intents users have in
a music streaming recommendation setting. Additionally, we identify
the importance of shared learning across intents and propose a
multi-level hierarchical model for user satisfaction prediction that
leverages user intent information alongside interaction signals. Our
findings from extensive experiments on a large scale real world data
demonstrate (i) the utility of considering different interaction signals,
(ii) the role of intents in interpreting user interactions and (iii)
the interplay between interaction signals and intents in predicting
user satisfaction.
# 12.Modeling Heart Rate and Activity Data for Personalized Fitness Recommendation(健康推荐)
## Abstract
Activity logs collected from wearable devices (e.g. Apple Watch,
Fitbit, etc.) are a promising source of data to facilitate a wide range
of applications such as personalized exercise scheduling, workout
recommendation, and heart rate anomaly detection.

However,
such data are heterogeneous, noisy, diverse in scale and resolution,
and have complex interdependencies, making them challenging to
model.

In this paper, we develop context-aware sequential models
to capture the personalized and temporal patterns of fitness data.

Specifically, we propose FitRec – an LSTM-based model that captures
two levels of context information: context within a specific
activity, and context across a user’s activity history.

# 13.Modeling Item-Specific Temporal Dynamics of Repeat Consumption for Recommender Systems
## Abstract
Repeat consumption is a common scenario in daily life, such as
repurchasing items and revisiting websites, and is a critical factor
to be taken into consideration for recommender systems. Temporal
dynamics play important roles in modeling repeat consumption.
It is noteworthy that for items with distinct lifetimes, consuming
tendency for the next one fluctuates differently with time. For
example, users may repurchase milk weekly, but it is possible to
repurchase mobile phone after a long period of time. Therefore,
how to adaptively incorporate various temporal patterns of repeat
consumption into a holistic recommendation model has been a new
and important problem.

In this paper, we propose a novel unified model with introducing
Hawkes Process into Collaborative Filtering (CF). Different
from most previous work which ignores various time-varying patterns
of repeat consumption, the model explicitly addresses two
item-specific temporal dynamics: (1) short-term effect and (2) lifetime
effect, which is named as Short-Term and Life-Time Repeat
Consumption (SLRC) model. SLRC learns importance of the two
factors for each item dynamically by interpretable parameters.

# 14.Multi-Task Feature Learning for Knowledge Graph Enhanced Recommendation(cross-domain recommendation)
## Abstract
Collaborative filtering often suffers from sparsity and cold start
problems in real recommendation scenarios, therefore, researchers
and engineers usually use side information to address the issues
and improve the performance of recommender systems.

In this
paper, we consider knowledge graphs as the source of side information.

We propose MKR, a Multi-task feature learning approach
for Knowledge graph enhanced Recommendation. MKR is a deep
end-to-end framework that utilizes knowledge graph embedding
task to assist recommendation task.

# 15.Multimodal Review Generation for Recommender Systems
## Abstract
Key to recommender systems is learning user preferences, which
are expressed through various modalities. In online reviews, for
instance, this manifests in numerical rating, textual content, as well
as visual images. In this work, we hypothesize that modelling these
modalities jointly would result in a more holistic representation of
a review towards more accurate recommendations. Therefore, we
propose Multimodal Review Generation (MRG), a neural approach
that simultaneously models a rating prediction component and a
review text generation component. We hypothesize that the shared
user and item representations would augment the rating prediction
with richer information from review text, while sensitizing
the generated review text to sentiment features based on user and
item of interest. Moreover, when review photos are available, visual
features could inform the review text generation further. Comprehensive
experiments on real-life datasets from several major US
cities show that the proposed model outperforms comparable multimodal
baselines, while an ablation analysis establishes the relative
contributions of the respective components of the joint model.

## contribution
We design the MRG model (see Section 3), which
jointly models rating prediction and text generation at the review
level by incorporating LSTM cells with a novel fusion gate as a
kind of soft attention to weigh the relative contributions of sentiment
features and visual features that provide context to the text
generation. We also describe the learning and inference algorithms
respectively.

# 16.Personalized Bundle List Recommendation
## Abstract
Product bundling, offering a combination of items to customers,
is one of the marketing strategies commonly used in online ecommerce
and offline retailers. A high-quality bundle generalizes
frequent items of interest, and diversity across bundles boosts the
user-experience and eventually increases transaction volume.

In
this paper, we formalize the personalized bundle list recommendation
as a structured prediction problem and propose a bundle
generation network (BGN), which decomposes the problem into
quality/diversity parts by the determinantal point processes (DPPs).
BGN uses a typical encoder-decoder framework with a proposed
feature-aware softmax to alleviate the inadequate representation
of traditional softmax, and integrates the masked beam search and
DPP selection to produce high-quality and diversified bundle list
with an appropriate bundle size.
